Predicting Hospital Readmission for Diabetes Patients Using Machine Learning.

Hospital readmissions are both dangerous to the patient and costly to the healthcare industry. Diabetics are especially vulnerable to requiring a readmission. By modeling twenty-one contributing variables, a random forest machine learning model can predict with over 77% accuracy those patients who have the potential for readmittance. This model could be using in a Clinical Decision Support system to provide improved patient outcomes.
